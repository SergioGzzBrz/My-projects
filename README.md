# MATLAB proyects
Here are all my MATLAB proyects. 
A description of each of them is provided, as well as images to show the results. 

Code can be found in this repository. 
- The proyects were all made in spanish, **however** comments and main text were translated to help non-spanish speakers
- Keep in mind some variable names may still be in spanish

## F1 Car simulation (with interface)

In this proyect, the **real time** simualtion of a car movement along the race track was created. Code is found on file "car_simulation.mlapp".

This proyect was finished November 2022. 

Here are some results:

**Important points:**
1. Physic calculations were done to determine wheter skidding was going to happen according to the car's velocity
2. The track was created by _simple cubic interpolation_, based on initial points
3. This proyect was created in teams, but the code was made by me. 
4. Created with MATLAB app designer
