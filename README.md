# MATLAB projects

Here are all my MATLAB projects. 
A description of each of them is provided, as well as images to show the results. 

Code can be found in this repository. 
- The projects were all made in Spanish, **however** comments and main text were translated to help non-Spanish speakers
- Keep in mind some variable names may still be in Spanish

## F1 Car simulation (with interface)

In this project, the *real-time* simulation of a car movement along the racetrack was created. 

This project was finished **November 2022**. Code is found on file "car_simulation.mlapp".

Here are some results:

**Important points:**
1. Physic calculations were done to determine whether skidding was going to happen according to the car's velocity
2. The track was created by _simple cubic interpolation_, based on initial points
3. This project was created in teams, but I was in charge on writing the code.
4. Created with MATLAB app designer


## Volcanic rocks trajectory simulation (parabolic shot)

In this project, a simulation of the trajectory of volcanic rocks was created. This was done by calculating the rock's position using Euler's method (numeric method). 

This project was Finished in **October 2022**. Code is found on file "Volcano_rocks_simulation.mlapp".

Here are some results

**Important points:**
1. This project was created in teams, but I was in charge on writing the code.
2. Created with MATLAB app designer.
3. Graphs not in real time, but drawn bit by bit for better visualization.
